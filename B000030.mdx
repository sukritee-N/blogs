Well my first-ever website build was finished today. But I might end up having some problems with deployment part of the process. Yet I am quite a bit happy now to be honest. And here our journey begins.  
 For now, I am planning to deploy this website on **Vercel**, in the hobby section obviously. But I'll have to figure something else out later. There are good hosting services out there. And, if I decide to go absolute balls to the walls, then might end up hosting on my own server(raspberry cluster and stuffs).  

 It's raining here,.. like for **hours** now. Whenever it rains I end up reminiscing about the past. Always been the thinker guy in the backbench. I am a bit ecstatic even though everything surrounding me is beyond depressing.  
 Now that I think about it I had plans to move to london later in my life because of it's depressing rainy weather. But unfortunately it seems London had her own plan to become an absolute meme. All we can do is sigh and move on.  

 BTW I watched the new Loki season 2 trailer today. I have valid reasons to be happy now, and once again it is absolutely lit. From visuals to sound tracks. And oh boy, do I love some godDamn good soundtrack. Now we wait, just a bit.

 SO this I guess this is about it. This was just a trial blog, not a serious one. Even this file is named as 0030, which means 0 in hex number system. But it doesn't need to be too serious, to be informative. A bit of fun and some serious all-nighter. And that's all life is about anyways.

 In the end it's just like an wise old man said, "Make some friends, make some enemies, make some memories"
