Hello there, it's me Kiri. Glad to see you here, for this is my first ever blog-post. I have no idea how to do it properly yet, still I am really happy to be doing this. And to begin a new journey altogether.

For now this website is on 'beta' stage, so there's a lots of works to be put in. But as they say just take a leap of faith without thinking much so I'm gonna just start posting right away.
 For now, I am planning to deploy this website on Vercel, in the hobby section obviously. But I'll have to figure something else out later as it grows towards it's final stage. There are good hosting services out there but I think I might end up going absolute balls to the walls and host on my own server(raspberry cluster and stuffs). You can say it's a personal interest thing of mine. But well time will tell.

It's raining here,.. like for hours now. Whenever it rains I end up reminiscing about the past. I am a bit ecstatic even though everything surrounding me is beyond depressing.
 Now that I think about it I had plans to move to london later in my life because of it's depressing rainy weather. But unfortunately it seems London had her own plan to become an absolute meme. So all we can do is sigh and move on.

BTW I watched the new Loki season 2 trailer today. My favourite show is back in the game. And it's lit from visuals to sound tracks. And oh boy, do I love some godDamn good soundtrack. Now we wait, just a bit.


My content would be mostly about technology, game development, visual effects, pseudo science, also a bits of history and mythology to fill in the gaps. And hope to see you soon again.


Good Night!
