It happened about 4 months ago. My mobile phone expired after 4 years of service. I was sad cause well you end up growing emotional attachment with the things you hold close to yourself. However, it is what it is.   
It was not really that inconvenient if I'm being honest, my productivity went up and for the fact nobody calls me or I have anybody to contact to it was afterall for the best. And I still do not use any mobile phone. Who needs phone anyway in 2023, amirite?   
However something went horrifyingly wrong. I lost anyway to play 'CoC'. And 'conveniently' enough CoC was not any desktop platform. I heard CoC will be available on Windows platform. So for someone like me who uses MacOS it's still a long way.

That's where the idea to write 'A Game That Has Nothing To Do With CoC' comes in.
