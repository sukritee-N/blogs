Hello there, it's me Kiri, again! Glad to see you here, for my second blogPost. If you're wondering about the title, I've just been listening to ['_Faithless_']{} by **vivivi** on repeat. Nothing beats 8-bit style of music and for the god's sake good old Pipe organ classical. And **Master Boot Records** is absolute GigaChad in that specific genre. And it goes without saying, **Keygen Church** is the best thing that could happen ever in my 19 years of life.  
 You see I go by only one rule in my life. "Life is binary, you're either alive or dead. So only do things that would keep you alive." And as it turns out my brain demands some stable supply of daily dopamine, or it can threaten my life. As in depression and stuffs. And music, programming n creative tasks happen to be best scalable source of pure dopamine. That's why music is a huge deal in my life.  
 Now speaking of vivivi, ['_Credit song to my Death_']{}
 is also one of my all time favourites.
